Design wise I wanted something that could easily be translated into mobile, and I think this does with the exception of the vertical header down the left hand side, which may take some rethinking.

This translator was built with testing in mind, and was test driven up until I changed the if statements to key:object values. I changed the tests once it was complete and made them pass by making sure each expected output was in a string.
